## NetPractice

NetPractice is a networking project that is part of the Hive Helsinki curriculum, aimed at understanding and applying fundamental concepts of TCP/IP addressing and network configuration. The project requires configuring small-scale networks and ensuring proper connectivity between devices by correctly setting up IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing.

The project involves completing 10 levels of networking exercises, each requiring the proper setup of network configurations. Upon completing each level, a get_config button provides a JSON file representing the final network configuration.

## Key Concepts
**TCP/IP Addressing**: Properly assigning IP addresses and subnet masks to devices within a network.

**Subnetting**: Dividing a network into subnets for better organization and efficiency.

**Routing**: Ensuring connectivity between different subnets or networks through correct routing configuration.

**Network Troubleshooting**: Identifying and resolving configuration issues in network setups.
